                <h2>About the Event</h2>
                <p>The Roux Academy’s annual conference and exhibit is designed to foster a 
                    close-knit relationship amongst artists at various universities around the world. 
                    But sign up early, as this not-to-miss conference sells out quickly, and the waiting 
                    list is long. In addition, art students are encouraged to send in 
                    works from their school portfolios to be considered for hanging in the CAC exhibit halls, 
                    as well as to be selected as a Featured Artist.</p>
                <h2>Featured Artists</h2>
                <p>The Roux Academy selects approximately 200 distinct pieces of contemporary art for display 
                    in their collective exhibit. Nine individuals are granted his or 
                    her own exhibit hall to display entire collections or themed pieces. Each Featured Artist 
                    has an opportunity to speak at the conference to share his or 
                    her vision, perspective, and techniques with conference attendees.</p>
